Data/Memos/output.wav,Asmorandamardicadaistinaculdacar,Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar," And here, believe me, in just an overview, I showed you the inside of the process. Hello, my name is Vess. Vess does not really exist in this room. I mean, surely he can be talking about this somehow, somewhere, but it's not in this description. So what happens is that in the toucher's names of people, in the toucher's names of like, locals, are less famous, basically, because models always hold the toucher, and it comes to the slider, and all the names are only in my head at the moment. So how do you fix it? Well, here, you take the same audio, and now you sort of back-overhead, even here, you put the digital motor, which is Vess, and you back-overhead, and you put the hand, and now it has knowledge of Vess. I know we have to explain how Vess is moving, because those models are very small, and they are not very upset. And as you imagine, you just sort of get in a little, and Vess, you know how much fun it is to shoot this in bi-block? I've also been shooting in a bi-block. You were quite a fun back-block. And then the model was able to not be aimed. So my goal, as usual, is that you just can slowly go to the laptop, you train it on your own, and you visit the best model out there for your own single-pixel. And if you're kind of looking for a website that might be in the southern company, then you can do my way, but I just want to tell you that on the land, just for you, it is audio, it is just sort of a quality pizza. And the land, when the laptop really feels quite low and without short, where you're kind of a pack that was about 90 years before, you can do it by machine. The second one is really a bit like extra. I don't expect many people to do it, but people in the past enjoy it, which is, which now you know how to, you know how it works. Here we're using cross-appention, but now you know how to get into the sub-appention. And if you have some audio, maybe you can use some sort of new type of talk-inser, which usually are useful like audio, let's say, with music, and then you can go on sort of a call-in sound set, and then you can handle 80 music. It doesn't look like a very, very small, but they're very cheap to trade, but there's a sort of extra asker to give that to you. But the main ones, I would say, are the first two and this one. I'm not going to go into more details, but are the tasks here? Yeah? Cool. So, oh, there's also just a table that I would give you, and I might give you a bit of a overview. Speech to text is a little bit simpler than text to feature, which happens to be way more complex. I'm not going to go through it in the part. I found this table, it was published at the end of March, or May. And it used to be very similar. So, again, you can kind of make a sense of what classes to share. So, the first one, all this is a save in the task, but those are just going to be more of a new train from Squatcher. But then the whisper is something that I want you to explain. So, the model was the easy to learn to go into, and this is one. Let's see, in the next slide, I'll go through the zoomer. Yeah, okay. Two things I want to talk about. The first one is not in this part here, and the second one is in this part here. And the last one, I think, should look incredibly different. So, the formula of the quarter is this one. This is your class in transformers, and now you should have this for the level of times. As you can see, we're just using the same ideas all over. Everyone is changing what they're doing with these and what they're not doing with these. So, we need them, and they do cost attention, by the way. So, if someone feels that they need adventures, I would like to see how self-attention would work here. So, just sort of find something even more, and just do self-attention, and see how that works. And really, I think all you can start learning to do is to have a conversation because you can crazy see things like that. Let's say we're going to have these at the end of the week. And then I'm going to write one with another vocabulary. Okay, plus the vocabulary for people I can't remember. So, what do we put inside the book order? Is the question, the book at the end? So, if you see that inside the book order over there, we have this massive idea, and I want to go through that. So, please, I can move. Maybe let me put it this way. We might want a very common question, which is, how would you program a book order behind a different user? Maybe you can put an image in the end order, but then sometimes you might want the book order to do different things. Sometimes you just want an option, tell it what's inside it, but maybe sometimes you want like, I know, you come up with something like that. You can really create this image by sort of giving some amounts or something like that. So, how would you sort of make the image order in a different way? So, how would you know that? I mean, this would be kind of here, but you create special contents, and depending on special contents, the book order will be shown in the different pages. You condition, even the stacks that are here in this order and those tokens that are here, you can do the stuff later. And this is a different class, I think. First, you have a container that says start or transfer, but even if you're not that much into the site, this book order is not going to be like training three decoders to do three different things. Maybe you can train one decoder to do three different things. So, start or go get them, we can pass. Some of those will be predicted by the model potentially, but others will be forced by us either way. So, we can give them all the start of the transcript, then the model might, we can give them all the freedom here, and we can say give me the next talker. If there is no sound, the model is just a bit more speech, and we detect that in our sort of decoder, and we exit it. But we look again and say end of transfer there. There's a second one. All of the model might just detect an adventure. So, the model of the monopony, the first thing that it does is to use the adventure. It's function versus the calendar. Questions? Well, if you haven't started a transcript, do you know the language or exactly the test type or the language? I'm talking about training or provisioning. Training there. I don't know how specific it is in the training here, but I imagine that they might have a cross-sectional loss. So, it has to come out like, yeah, yeah, five tokens, and I'm going to give you one more stop. But in the prediction, though, it doesn't mean that you can track it. Yeah, but another way of this is in the transcript it's a way to identify an adventure which is going to start with standards and then the model will go right here. So, the model has got all the information. The model has already done a one-two analysis to get the transcript, which is one of our steps. Are there any more languages? No. I'm also talking about the multiple weights to change it. This is just sort of how this was trained. What was that? Is this then like a generative or next token prediction type of task? Yeah, this is just sort of, you know, it's basically the same as what you've done so far. The only thing you haven't done is like, can you introduce some special tokens so that people there can do their things? Sometimes, as you imagine, we say, caption as a sort of special token and then all these other things are captioned. Or maybe we can say like story and then we want to create a story about this key object. And we kind of want this to be called an indelible thing. It's a very special token, and again, a special token here is not because it's special in any way, it just goes like it's not part of the... It's part of the cardinal, right? It's not part of the world we created. It's a condition token. Yeah? What do you think about this here in terms of having a single goal that we get is more important, specializing in the goal? Why are we creating something like this? Well, because we're the big, the sexist, the master, and we know that like those things generalize really well, that's given up. So we want to sort of... And clearly, I mean, why is there such a rush of charging to see all possible things in order and then this super generalizing point because we prove that there are more things here? I think that may kind of expand a little bit. Now, how about that for the big, bloody wind part? Like you were doing the thing we were doing back then, and it was a catalyzed one. If you have to teach it to somebody new, you don't have to come and get it, do you? Well, at that point, you're kind of might have to be careful about what's dangerous and you would be teaching it because you have to think about how it's going to function afterwards, and then it's always going to be tricky. If you think, well, if I'm going to train this to do ten things, or if you say I'm going to train this one thing, or I'm going to train this to do ten things, and then it becomes a question of computing data. Like, we know that those models learn from each other, like a classic example, but I'm not smacking it, because it's a very common knowledge thing. They only did it in texas, and it was okay. That was also the thing they thought of. Why don't we just put more much of code so that the model does text and code, and suddenly the model became better at text creation because it was trained with code. But also at the same time, we learned that part of the code. So what would you have done? Why would you have trained the model on more data sets but clearly the point is the same. They trained one model on the text and one model on the code, but then neither of them were going to be better. So instead of training one classic model, I'm sure you can kind of feel it in the new school. I guess the case is kind of like the GPOS. Of course it is, that's why we train what we do by computer, because if you start to have new tokens, you also learn the data to back. That part is a sort of fast-get. I want to talk about some of the concepts here. Because then it becomes a long journey of life. We're trying to understand these different types of code sequences. Is construction, is there a single model? Yeah, all we have is one model. What am I saying? When we first started with code data? So conditional state or what kind of state? We do have conditional state as well, but we can't ever find a case of data before we start with the set answer. This is going to be controlled. So I don't understand why it's going to be complex and I think a lot of the people that are doing the program have seen they can't receive this quickly, but then the confusion is going to be here. So we pass the model to a start token and then the model will be the next token. And here we're showing the model to all the speed-eaters just a subset of token. We don't want the model to start with object because we want to tell people to drop the website. So we say, okay, we have to commit only two things. If there is no switch, it's a silence, actually. If otherwise, I'd have the language. Then here, I also... This is not something that the model does quite itself. I force it, but I'm not a specialist. I say, okay, I want a transcription here or I want a translation. So this is again, one point after and I'll see if there's a token for software. Then... Second... Because I'm not a specialist. I'm going to translate it right into the demo. I'm going to sort of go through it in a second. So we send those two tokens up. So we tell them all about the specific tasks that I want you to do. Then... I can pass like another potential token although if we are... It's kind of set up in this way. I hope that if you could do this one differently, it doesn't matter. If I say translator, the model now is going to translate it. Which if you talk like in English, then you say trans... So if you talk in Italian, I think this policy translates X to English. So you can talk in Italian and then you can say translator and this is just going to sort of output that and here you need the model free. You say, okay, I think we did it and then the model will just start to work in English. With an output that was in Italian. But I said first, you can say I want transcription and then the model will sort of start to... to transcribe my copy. And then I can say I want no timestamps so it just needs to be in the free text or I want some timestamps which are like coming... sort of the way it's sort of... Again, I don't want you to look at this and be like oh my god this is so confusing. This is just funny. So how can... If you think about it, what the hell can we do besides passing the token? Surely you can go in and just start to change the means because we want that... I wish you a future. So what else can we do to make all that to target that to different types of... and only way to organize it with this sort of like mechanics of tokens is to try to find a path because this is something that open an idea that's in the light to look for a chapter and to do this with like this to a summary, please, and like drum checker and all the rest of it. And this is pretty much it. Yeah? I think I should have put this on the children's top. The way that they think is that all we are doing here is just program and decoder and... which is amazing. Talking about what it means with mechanics, it helps to do all right. It's backed up by all the training data you've designed so that they know how to work that mechanism. Yeah, immediately, you must have had that of how much you're training data set and you know special tokens included so that all the learns what you have to do and what you can tell. So your data set should contain a bunch of scenarios that cater to each of this project. Yeah. So you have to create your own data set. You don't have to do it because at least there's a way to do that. So the final part of what they're trying to do is what they're going to train. This program is like a program of how we write those training examples. And then the language program you learn this program and then after you get it done. Yeah, we got on the other one although I don't say more. I don't say it's all about that. They want... Like a formal language. Yeah, not really. Because it's not just one language or things that we've looked at. Although it could be. Because here, I don't know about any other systems. Can you tell me about the end of the program? Are we telling them all? Now that's the data about the model. And I get that. So here unfortunately some of those can be hard coded by us when we want the model to do something and the model can do that by itself. Exactly. In general terms, we say that the model can do something. I suppose it depends on generalizing what we want the model to be. In this case, we want the model to be a couple of things. But if you kind of let this one do a texture, like... Or just like here for the wheel on a texture, which other one you can't do. So how do you open the idea to make it so generalize? Well, this space is not super generalizable. Like... We're not talking about the language model, so we have some sort of super generalizing work sheets. This one just does a couple of tasks. And just because of our story, I don't know if this is going to be or if it's going to be a little too old for you. But because I remember when I was in the NAC center when I talked to the NAC team, and it doesn't have an manual as much as maybe I wrote it into a piece, but that, which a month ago, I would put the audio out of the start to chapter, the chapter to G, and then it would transcribe the audio inside the input box and the transcription to the Italian. I initially said this after the English, because it's a French center, and the output was... Because the transcription depends on the region of the job, but the transcription was in Italian. Does this happen to you? Does this happen to me? It happens to me a lot when it takes. I will ask something in English and starts to reply in Portuguese, even though I don't want that. Yeah, yeah, I saw it. Yeah? And so, I don't really need to say this, but I have strong suspicions in two. And what happens there, I think, is that the model is being by itself, or two things that... Because I don't know why I'm doing this but clearly most of us want the transcription, but I imagine what's happening there is I don't know, I'm clearly more disappointed in this full of memories. And then the model that you get there is Italian or Portuguese, but it's what you say in English. I just have a good question about the model that you didn't necessarily want to open it up to you. What about the interview? Well, not the interview, but we start with what's there. So, we just really just like see what's there. The same joke is in creating the whole world. So, you look at it, you can't be there, but you don't just go to the top of the chart. How nice is that? How nice is that? When you should just go there. So, does the font can be filled like a long language, but in language? Yeah, okay, that was one. But for me, sure, think of which I use. Other languages, like I mean all languages are languages. Most of them are languages in South Africa, or South America. So, most languages you use are sure there. But others don't. And that's what you're going to do. Good. Yeah, that's true. We're taxed, but the popular way to get an awesome problem with the association of terrorists, so I'll do it in a way that it's a little bit better. Oh, yeah, that's why they look at it even more complex. So, I'm thanks for teaching me because we have a problem. Let's have a look at the next part of here. So, let's suppose we're really at this image. We do a convolution 1D. What is a convolution 1D? And I just want to show you very quickly where here the camera's size is 1 and we have a model that's going to look at this is this image. And let's take one sort of slice of this property. This would be quite good. And as usual, not too basic. So, in the previous week where the patch was not included, here we don't do that instead we just take a slice and instead of sort of doing a minor layer so we're just taking all of these and projecting them down, we could do some of these by defector which is this is our slice of the whole inputter. And then we kind of go with camera size 1 which really means that this is our element of our actor. Can we take this number? Times this number and then we get those out. This is our 1Kernel 1D convolution. Super straight forward. We take this number multiply by that then we move down we take this number multiply by that and we get out. Yeah. So now, what happens if we do that too? Well, we kind of follow the same program. So, we take now we take those two guys then we do this times this and then inside them and then we get those out. So, we're kind of taking like as convolution, we're closing each other and kind of moving away from them and then we produce 1's out. And this is the same formula now we increase the camera size. Now, we also increase the dimension and we can keep the same camera size increase the dimension out because that means this. So, I just want to look at it again. Because it's easy to get lost in this and that and do stuff. What do we do here? We do the same formula twice and we have two outputs. So, we take this times this then we take this times this then we sum that together and then we same here. But now, we have another one. So, we also take this times this this times this we sum that together and take this. So, as you can see, we kind of increase from the dimensionality here. And then, at least at this camera, we learn to look for different patterns and this camera will also look for different patterns. And then we kind of get the result out. I'm going to make this super clear because I'm going to ask Charlie if he can go to the conclusion one, you go live, then you can go to the market about your matter. Well, I think that operations are super straightforward and I also have a question about this. There's no interesting question which is the last one. What happens as you look down here as a new down here we have a question about this guy who is here. And we can't do it. And these times this we will still not produce another as they do. But then we can't do more down here because we've got another one here. So, we can't do it also to produce the front of the matter. So, you have to be careful with the size of here because that's where we start to produce a new angle here so that you can produce the front of the matter. It's so wish. Otherwise, it's just you can't do it. Do you want to make it circular? Like, getting the first to give me a second. Or you can then make it decently circular. No, the ones on the water you can use I don't know. So, make it circular. Okay. Are you sure? You just have to make sure that by the information you're giving you with the big size. You are thinking of making a fiber and then this and this so to say the word. But then this feature might be very different in the speech and you sort of are combining. You're thinking of the first feature on the left with the last feature on the right. But we didn't have an operation in the field as long as information was in excess. When will you make sense of the progress you're making? It's I would say that it forward is pursued better than a conclusion because it's way more popular. But it's super simple that we have to do it. And maybe you don't really need to see it forward. The result of this is going to be the result of all of them. Kind of softer together and more popular. But maybe this result here should be just the I mean it's just an imperfect bias. Pixels close to each other should just operate with close to each other. And here, frequencies close to each other should just operate with close to each other. It's an assumption you make yourself and you make theirs. So before recording out your long and long expected value I'm going to commentize on some of the personal mechanics but people will also see as if they know. Those numbers there in the context of sound would be taking that as a picture and using the pixels as well. Is that always the procedure or could you use other things rather than an image to represent the text and how would those other things I'm just going to go ahead and think about that which is what is this image? That you can like clearly in your sense it would be different than the audio we just saw a second ago. So let's have a look here of what that is. In simple terms this is if you take like a whole space like let's say a 1 in the whole space here and then this point that's kind of going to go down is going to be a jiggle there is a sort of the wave force or the energy that sort of all your voice might also any audio sort of like going through space so just about a whole case kind of going to a white background is going to be there that vibration that is shown here So as we talk at any point it's clearly multiple points in space at a nice value of collaboration because of the distance there so the energy that participates and you can keep that but so if you take a 1 in the whole of this space in time and we see how it moves it's kind of like you kind of have to zoom in here but you can see it's just not going to be one line of sort of wave teaser in that specific aspect and as you can see it's kind of going to be here it's going to move differently from the whole point or pervading at this level is going to be tricky because there is quite a bit of information in this sort of momentum that can take a little bit of answer another way of decomposing all of this sort of wave form is that almost factor-wise or we can we can take any wave form like this and describe it in sort of a main component so that if it kind of like treat it with all is that there it's very complex it can change sometimes like sometimes the silence sometimes some shots so the waves are going to be very regal it's going to be really hard to look at them in the side of the art but we know what you can do is split it into many many components and usually you're sort of signing a different frequency do you do like a Fourier kind of program? yeah, yeah that's what I was going through but it could sort of like a composition a Fourier transform there's quite a bit to talk about the idea that you should take away from here is that given given sort of a wave form which is very very loud, it's a real wave form we kind of split it back in the component when we sum them back together we should get back the original wave form just like that if I give you any number you should be able to split it in the sort of like two or five number or any two or one of the set so it's a real factorization you can split it in the components where you can sum them together and you get back the original that's the question that's very smart that's a very good thing and in this way it always represents the change quite well the change is depending on where you are so one of the problems that we whisper at our users is to figure out who they speak to if you have two representations which you can create from the ground do you think it would work better? I don't think the whisper was trained for that way I don't think that way so people in the last four who managed to get whispered to do that way I don't think it was maybe a better factor but I think the data is a little bit more tricky but it can do another fraction but you are likely to like it whatever your recording was it is going to have a slightly different format but hopefully if you decompose it there's still going to be a signal because your voice should have some on the main elements of it that doesn't really matter how far you are you might be able to but the components are always going to be the same do people manage to recover their own shape from that way? yeah people have all sorts of things but you can imagine the information is there as you can see that if you like some of the decomposition of those two modules it's going to look different and the interesting part here is that the frequency that you see are very high compared to these ones that I am using here while at Jack Hammond we can see the space that the computer makes much faster for time steps than really when a song plays so I kind of said something before and I might which is not completely correct which is that if you take these and decompose it you can just want to find all the sounds or all sorts of like the main elements that compose this way but then I thought they would come all the way back actually because if you play that at Jack Hammond here then we play a song here when we do this sort of like how many soundways we have here we are kind of going to do that where the sort of soundways are combined with the Jack Hammond or Bob or a software so this is something that this will like part of like this quick Fourier transform and we do this sort of decomposition of multiple leg sets so we take like 60 little cycles of audio and we do a composition of the sound and we kind of display them usually we display them in this way so in this audio we see like the soundways of this frequency like those dominates those show up quite well I think a little light but that comes as time to go back here I think it's a amplitude or a energy yeah so what are the sounds of all the soundways that the microphone murder at that point well what was just the energy so Thomas was vibrating that's the same that the microphone is using just like a faulty spacer where sort of this waves both and just like in the scene we put like a balloon and you kind of fix it to the ground the only thing you see in the balloon is this kind of stop or down that's the only thing that the balloon can do and here we go to the same we put the spacer and we just go back and the result of that is a compressor so the more that energy the higher the amount of the dirt and the more sort of the people will talk about it but where are the babies do you know any of the babies of the factory I don't know about that but if the baby sort of like it comes out there to be able to construct the organosemely you can bring it to the baby of the design but that can be not an information factor the baby maybe they do like in the sort of for your trust but they're interesting part there is that will sort of if you do the decomposition of this entire waiver that's what you're going to get back there but if I get then it gave you only that that energy you construct this you can because it can kind of give you all information so that you can do the things but what is it the example is very good exactly the answer is to transform every system in the second and then let's see the next one the data because it doesn't go to much in the editor then what we get out of it is that each device here is actually how much the frequency is present so if you think about this is a time cycle I think it's about like 60 degrees cycle or something like that you do a full year transform or a whole hour deal and then this is sort of only one they I think they actually are better at drawing we kind of we we take a maybe 60 degrees cycles here we do a full year transform then we take this buffer then we multiply it and we kind of take our nice slabs where each element is a corresponds to a frequency to a response and we're back to the frequency so it's a frequency D1 so we wrap our brain by just a slice of the bullet yeah but you can kind of adjust it for all of it but then you can kind of use information we just we're walking back to the cell because this is just a sort of composition of all the science that we're going to use in the high-reser where if we do this very quickly we're going to have a frequency for that 60 degrees cycle we have high frequency low frequency then if we do this many many times in this switch channel we're going to have a full year transform for each of those channels then we kind of rotate the booster and when we look at that we are going to say that we're going to say that frequency frequencies between 0 and 20 are going to be the first spotter what was the magnitude? the magnitude was like all the number was there and sort of kind of go this order what that means is that let's put one for you keep the zoom in look at this other structure around here you can see that sometimes like at the zoom in, like all the frequencies are present in that first 60 milliseconds or those ones then as the sort of sounds go by you see here that we have like little bit more white like more frequencies of the sort of times that we have 60 milliseconds we do a full year transform we take all the frequencies in the screen piece so we can see which frequencies are present we're trying to get a little bit of a picture of what frequencies where are the 60 milliseconds in the original video and here we are waiting to compose to give a model of not a data to work but that's why this is part of the model nowadays people are on the board just as they were on the board to develop and the model will figure it out itself because maybe we'll find that full year transform is not that good and we'll come out and we'll collect extrapolation of the information that we need to send we usually need massive amounts of data for that but people clearly again the goal is that just pass the whole data to the transform and get the whole data back that's sort of the dream but without that my mom said we in the class parts of society should be mine too I know I know I'm not very good at it not about the people I don't know because this place is super dumb and sorry I can't do it I know this is quite a bit and I encourage you to maybe chat with each other about what are the main aspects of this digital game from like War Audio and these kind of picture like in the digital spectrum there's so much to figure out this is something that is done all the time in the world so it's not a machine that can't satisfy I wanted to show you some call to do the function in it just to sort of speak that pops this up a bit because we've already seen it but we take the high logic, we know the model we we sort of prepare actually until we call the model together sort of we take the model decoder and then we pass the cut-throat thing that we call and try to make it so simple and then still we have to get confused there we take the open we create our manufacturer we just initialize the token and the standard we initialize the decoder option so we take the model we just put the open water okay we just put the water and if they are sponsored it's Hello My",,,,,,,
Name is Baster which is the name of the company and this is if you want to use whisper as a user but we want to back up our game so we kind of create the tokens that we want to shoot at to make them better we sort of table the model of our cursor we create our course function which in this case is again next to our combination out of a cut-throat so it's of course actually set the model to the trigger which I imagine fixes the job hours or activates the job hours and then the end of the thing then we create again a spectrum and here I sort of like set it to the model again and I get the addition the target and the addition sort of like I smoke everything by one this was me clearly doing also a piece before so that I know what I want to go with so that you just come up with those like piece to piece and I'm going to divide them into two and then the interesting part is that I just do one you see there's no mood here I just do one set and then I back up against the trigger as you're going to back up I move the cursor I don't know what the learning rate is some of that must have set it up or here super slow here the model is weak at the slide and then another two keys will be set up maybe at the beginning I set it too small and then the model up and then I hit again I need to show you how to model again model the key value model the total as again and then I click on the addition again and then I have the model to do it with something like this how do we operate with or without time stamps in that like you could say hello my name is Bers or you could say hello my name is Bers and that surely there is a distinction within the model you mean the tokens of Bers not the last answer yeah I guess just like if you're getting it to compare you know back prop the audio that you give it with the text that you're saying it has that it's supposed to be predicting there's a massive distinction in the phrasing I don't know what the output looks like I don't know if it includes like the pause well I imagine here it's going to become a little bit tricky for you to be closer if I go back to this token sir right here with the last of the model I can't if I hit a hard call with all of these sir I call them on the right start of the transcription this is English how do you transcribe but not time stamps and then I say this is an issue that I pass to the speaker now it's up to us what we want to back over here and where we need to create a lot of circles here I don't necessarily want the model to sort of try to make it English any model for creating English here here I don't know what it was but if I hit that call I can also do English and I'm kind of going to give it a wonderful as a signal to kind of do I don't remember what I did exactly there I'm not the guy who started in between but it was also designed that this part is the only model where you actually don't translate the loss and not the rest you simply you know just like in the last few years I can't finish the answer the first time I was using the other space like what did you compare with the other a second just ignore it so here wouldn't be so fast for you to do everything just like to back up on you to the name which at all though is the model just that that information I think that that's the macabre of what you said the output that you want from the outer to the top the arrow is what are the talking sounds what are the instructions what are the output you mean what if I was just trying to as the model I saw I put the model up towards it and then I kind of walked it down and the model should save it and check I passed both of them to the talkinizer and then I found out that this is what the model could be ok, you're not excited ok so you're going to sort of try to put things apart and go ahead and wait ok, this is a little bit and and here is the example yeah so here I passed all of it clearly it will be interesting how I did that calculate cross function if I can't remember what the model even more I get the transcribed long time stopper and although our logic is useful as well nevertheless with one fact propagation the model is not consistent as well so that's something that you are going to play and you can try being very specific in the main set of operation and also how much you can affect the project of the model and then I said start from micro or then the text was it embedded like tokenized did you make bets as a new token effectively I guess no,, target squeezer to Easter and then you just put it up and it also shakes there I don't feel that this is the the spectrum yes this is the spectrum because I asked it one spectrum the spectrum is like 80 pieces of of the same thing in the second set so you just receive it and then each one has so the 3000 frequencies that we might be able to and each one can have an output this is my best and this example you pre-processed in the audio or is the model doing that as one of its steps yeah just like you have those things with a pre-processed function and so on so going back to the point where you say just this one competition where you tell the model that best piece is very important in the world is it kind of a bad thing kind of like misleading or can ruin the model in the future it's not a question about it it's basically it's a big thing but what I want to do is to let it go but if we have everyone in class with that 13th accent say the same sentence and get some training with like model example of the same word with that the left one is from the there will be less but only if you put all of it in the culture so the model was all that in one go then you sort of start to differentiate and learn many things but if you do it only in series first with me then James then the last person is the person who is going to be and this is kind of like why Shafiq is so important because if you try all images of class all images of class then usually the last analysis is always what they want or is biased towards those things the reason the back is important is because we are taking the average from the standing off within the back we know it's sort of like a similar example I don't have to almost a 90s to my right say of the entire generation but we know that as the sample becomes bigger thanks to essentially in theory we know that the sample properties are very similar to the the creation properties and that some of this background is similar in the way that I actually so for example I like I like to use the program as much as you can if you pull it fast you might read it so in that spectrum is the assumption that if all of us were to record the same word it would somehow be similar or not it would be very different if I say hello you say hello and the representation is very this is a bit about the world of classroom number two the classroom number two here just gave one example of what we have found which I think will be interesting to be like can you play a mystery which is I'll get in the water it's called and then find you in the water and see how active it can be because this would be useful for that to work and the sample one please can you play a special organza can you introduce new special organza with new strings and that realization is one of that for that you can especially look at the same speaker change and then people have to say speak and then the name of the speaker that's the other just a speaker change and that's that's a bit of a lie and that's something quite quite interesting quite a lot of confidence out there is the recording and the characterization and I think it's going to be not that many of them but if you try to highlight the word and you say please this is something that you can try to draw then they have to run discussion of just who is the one that you pass might be hard and that's a whole another piece of piano and they can be really have to ask this play if I can ask a follow up I think I was more getting to the point where for words we want a representation where despite the accent whatever it shows up there is kind of the same so my question is like whether that's the best representation to go from all the other words there's another representation where it would be more similar if we're saying the same word oh what do you mean by the one with the picture that picture we see the one in the middle the spectra, right? so I was asking if we say the same word and the follow up is like if not sure that we should use another thing because if we're trying to extract words then we want my word and your word to be the same and maybe if we're trying to extract the music or something else then we will use a different representation of sound that's more similar between like an instrument that's a good question the way things are done so far in a man's culture one usually should be different between the two clearly where different slightly different frequencies but the point is that the music should shouldn't be attention there too much and should still understand that the core idea of what we both said that we shouldn't be trained for that but the point is that I can't understand what gets involved because I since Henry got his role there in terms of music there I mean this is still one of the best ways for a present music there the frequencies, I mean those are perfect frequencies but the point is that the music should be the same and it's every multiple part and we want it to be direct and we don't want us saying that we don't want to represent and not to be expected exactly the reason why I was asking was that maybe do we need to consider what to represent based on the purpose of what we're trying to do so if we're trying to look at us where it's different then we want it to be the same and we want it to be the same but it seems like this is just a state of the art and we always go with these the administration is not there should we do that or should we do that but that's quite what you're asking why train one to do everything to get theoretically and have multiple because you find something that represents what's in the digital world you know, it could just be but no, I just realized maybe I should introduce you to how I'm doing I hate this part I'm an X1 we didn't want to be like that so she wanted to come over and we were going to speak I'm meeting with her about coming over I guess I'll try meeting her which makes it so don't come out there every company out there is using their battery or what we're trying to do we're trying to use their battery to use which size is it that's quite big it's quite big that's it quite a spark that's cool this was a little bit longer it wasn't too heavy there's a lot of stuff to cover but again, try today to talk through it with the rest of the team make sure you understand the task and you understand the blocks that I can kind of question if you know what we're doing we'll have a question," sir good night everyone thank you thank you do you feel like you got the answer you were looking for earlier with the songwriters with the gaps in the speech I think both something that both of you and Jair were getting at were as well if you want your model to be able to tell the difference then that's one sort of model and if you want your model to not tell the difference that's another sort of model and if we try to find you but you can imagine if the intent behind the model was just give me text we're not trying for like comedy and anything just give me the words then you personally try to not have it emit those tokens otherwise you can have it emit hat tokens or something similar and you could totally train it if it wasn't currently emitting hat tokens to emit some hat tokens if you want or like more consignments to open and it wasn't that I wanted to do that or it's that surely the model must take into account there is a gap and it either shortens the gap by going for nothing's here so I'm either going to end it or cut it or put it in a token that says I would be stunned if there wasn't a hat token so it looks like they all pretty much have a hat token my group is already complicated and left so I'm going to have fun wanna flip it oh it's going already that was super whispering from the start"""
